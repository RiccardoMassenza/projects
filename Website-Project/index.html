        <h2>How this project was born...</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="column">A fun little project to explore the beauty of 3d printing, assemblying and building. <br> What started as a joke quickly became an adventure that led me to deepen my understandings of physics, 3d modelling and electronics. <br> This project was a learning opportunity and a fun experience at the same time: picking the design, installing and coding the electronics. It is truly beautiful to see with your eyes your creations taking shape and even more fascinating the idea of  producing real electricity from something you built. <br> The building of this turbine has allowed me not only to set off my curiosity but also to direct my creativity towards something practical.</div>
                <div class="column">This project has also given me the idea to create this website: a cool opportunity to learn how to code to create a stylish and creative website to store all my projects documentation in a detailed way. <br> I've always wanted to build something worth it and I feel like this is the very first time I have achieved it: I've put a lot of effort into planning and building and I reckon this build has come together beautifully. <br> This is the first of the projects that I planned to make and many more are to come (check out also the <a href="" id="Ugrinsky-Wind-Turbine">Ugrinsky Wind Turbine</a> project), so stay tuned!</div>
